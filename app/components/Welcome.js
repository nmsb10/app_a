I was looking to find an apartment in Chicago at short notice and had a bunch of things I was particular about; Jonathon helped me find a place that offered them all! Jonathon helped me find my first rental pretty quick and when it was time to purchase my first home I knew I\'d want to get his help. He\'s always just a phone call away, at any time and has always been very helpful. Jonathon has a solid understanding of the real estate market and helped me understand the intricacies of the purchase process so that I felt comfortable and well-informed at every stage. He was also very accommodating of various requests and was thorough in his research and responses to various questions of mine. Always courteous and prompt, working with Jonathon has always been a pleasure. He\'s my go to guy for any Real Estate needs!',

From beginning to end Jonathonâ€™s professionalism was impressive.We originally chose Jonathan as an agent because we had received a mailing from him for homes in the neighborhood that clearly stood out above the rest. He did not disappoint. He had a professional photographer take pictures of the property, created a beautiful brochure and provided great online exposure. Jonathon also accompanied potential buyers to all the showings and provided us with feedback. He also kept us up to date on market activity. We were extremely pleased with Jonathon and look forward to working with him whenever we need an agent.',

We would recommend you to friends and potential clients without reservation, and would tell them the following:Jonathon won our business through his professional and thorough approach, and obtained a legitimate offer on our property (which subsequently resulted in a sale) within three weeks of listing. He provided us with timely, detailed and accurate market information to enable us to make informed decisions about the listing and sale of our condominium. He then aggressively marketed the property through customized mailings of his own design, extensive internet marketing, and a custom property website. He continually explored new sources of potential buyers. Our neighbors in the building commented on the fact that they received two mailings about our condominium within the short period of time it was on the market. Jonathon\'s hard work and creative approach worked for us, and are certain to produce successful results with future listings.',

					quote: 'We would like to express our enthusiastic endorsement of Jonathon Nagatani as a REALTOR. Among his many strengths are good listening and communication skills, diligence, enthusiasm and attention to detail. After not being able to sell our home in the Edgebrook neighborhood for nearly a year, we turned to Jonathon and the Koenig & Strey company to represent us as sellers. Jonathon developed and implemented a strong marketing program and then met with us weekly to provide a detailed analysis of the results to date. As a result of Jonathon\'s work of finding qualified buyers and the value-add of the Koenig & Strey network and services, we went under contract in less than a month in the winter of 2011. Jonathon negotiated aggressively on our behalf, facilitating a deal with which we were very pleased. He continued to work proactively, monitoring each step of the process through to a successful close.We absolutely would work with Jonathon again and highly recommend that you select him as your REALTOR.',
